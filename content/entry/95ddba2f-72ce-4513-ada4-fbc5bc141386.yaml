                      Located on the Nicoya Peninsula, Tamarindo is a classic
                      starting point for surfers. The sandy bottom beach break
                      delivers consistent waves year-round, making it perfect
                      for beginners and intermediates. The lively town offers
                      loads of surf schools, great eats, and nightlife to round
                      off a perfect day in the water.

                      Just south of Jaco, Playa Hermosa is a mecca for
                      experienced surfers. Its powerful beach break can deliver
                      heavy tubes, especially during the rainy season. The
                      black-sand beach stretches for miles and hosts
                      international surf competitions, drawing talent from all
                      over the world.

                      The chilled jungle town of Santa Teresa has become a
                      surfer’s and digital nomad’s paradise. Expect fun beach
                      breaks, point breaks, and a welcoming scene for both
                      longboarders and shortboarders. The sunsets here are
                      legendary, and the consistent swell means you can catch a
                      ride pretty much any season.

                      Wave chasers flock to Pavones for a reason: it’s home to
                      one of the longest left-hand breaks in the world. On the
                      right swell, you can ride a single wave for nearly a
                      kilometer! The sleepy village and untouched nature make
                      this a dream spot for surfers looking for adventure off
                      the main route.

                      Another favorite on the southern Pacific coast, Dominical
                      offers steep, powerful breaks that attract experienced
                      surfers. The town has a laid-back vibe, with yoga retreats
                      and organic cafes dotting the main strip. If you’re
                      chasing big, consistent waves, this is your place.

          The best surf spots in Costa Rica for conscious explorers

          If catching consistent swells and living the pura vida lifestyle are
          on your bucket list, Costa Rica tops the list for eco-minded surfers
          and adventure seekers. From relaxed beach towns to remote jungle
          breaks, there’s a wave here for everyone—no matter your level. Here’s
          your guide to the top surf spots that deliver thrills, community
          vibes, and mindful travel experiences.

          1. Tamarindo

          Set on the Nicoya Peninsula, Tamarindo is the ultimate launchpad for
          beginner and intermediate surfers. With sandy-bottom beach breaks and
          reliable waves all year, this vibrant town is packed with locally run
          surf schools, friendly instructors, and a buzzing food scene. Surfers
          here can refuel with fresh fish tacos and join in for sunset
          sessions—the ultimate pura vida energy.

          When to go: November–April brings mellow surf for beginners. Bigger
          swells roll in May–October for those chasing a challenge.

          Sustainability tip: Look for surf camps supporting beach cleanups and
          eco-certified hostels.

          2. Playa Hermosa (near Jaco)

          Just south of Jaco, Playa Hermosa draws experienced surfers thanks to
          its powerful, world-class waves and epic rainy season tubes. This
          sprawling black-sand beach even hosts international surf
          competitions—expect a lively local surf scene and plenty of
          inspiration for your next session.

          Insider tip: Only paddle out if you’re confident in heavy surf.
          Beginners can spectate from the shore where surf culture is thriving.

          Community connect: Support local sodas for authentic eats after your
          session.

          3. Santa Teresa & Mal País

          Santa Teresa and Mal País are where laid-back vibes meet world-class
          surf. With playful beach and point breaks for both longboarders and
          shortboarders, this is a favorite with chill locals and digital nomads
          alike. After your session, explore community-run yoga shalas and
          sustainable cafes tucked among the jungle.

          Year-round waves: Consistent swell makes anytime a good time to visit.

          Responsible travel: Choose eco-lodges or family-run guesthouses to
          support the local community.

          4. Pavones

          Seeking something legendary? Pavones is home to one of the planet’s
          longest lefts, where you can ride a wave for almost a kilometer on a
          good day. The remote village and wild nature set the scene for a real
          adventure, with plenty of time to connect with the locals and enjoy
          untouched landscapes.

          Best for: Intermediate to advanced surfers with stamina to spare.

          Off the beaten path: Minimal crowds and rustic accommodations make for
          an authentic, nature-first experience.

          5. Dominical

          On the southern Pacific coast, Dominical is the classic laid-back surf
          town where yoga, organic eats, and big waves rule. The steep beach
          break is ideal for more experienced surfers, while nearby Dominicalito
          welcomes newcomers with gentler rides and a supportive surf school
          scene.

          Community highlight: Join local-led yoga or volunteer for beach
          cleanup days between surf sessions.

          Sustainable stays: Book eco-friendly hostels to support conservation
          efforts.

          Top tips for surfing Costa Rica the eco-friendly way

          Respect local surf etiquette and always greet your fellow surfers—it’s
          all about good vibes here.

          Ask local guides about currents and safe zones, especially during
          green season when swells grow.

          Choose reef-safe sunscreen and reusable water bottles to protect the
          ocean and wildlife.

          Opt for community-based lessons or rentals, which directly support the
          local economy.

          Travel light—many towns offer board rentals and budget group lessons.

          Final thoughts

          Costa Rica’s surf scene is more than just waves—it’s about connecting
          with the people, the vibrant nature, and sustainable travel
          traditions. Whether you’re a first-timer or a seasoned shredder,
          you’ll find your place (and your tribe) here. Pack your board, keep it
