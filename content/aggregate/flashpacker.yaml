  Flashpackers are travelers who embrace the freedom and spontaneity of
  backpacking but do so with a bigger budgetâ€”think lightweight backpacks paired
  with boutique hostels, frequent flights, and plenty of tech gear in tow. In
  short, they want the authentic, flexible experience of the road without
  sacrificing comfort, style, or connectivity.
